# Bevelop

Bevelop is intended to be a set of productivity tools for developers. The first component I'm working is the File Watcher.

# File Watcher

This feature gives you notifications when someone starts changing a file in a git repo locally, which you are also editing. It also allows you to to a diff between your version and their version of the file.


# How to Run

* Execute the server component:

```
Bevelop.Server.exe http://localhost:1111
```

If not specified the default URL is `http://localhost:8080`

* Run or install the VSIX (`Bevelop.VSClient`)
